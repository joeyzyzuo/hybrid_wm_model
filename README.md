This project contains the code and scripts required to reproduce results in the manuscript:

Joey Zhaoyu Zuo, Li-Zhuang Yang, Hai Li
*Immediate Reward Representation in Working Memory Can Drive the Model-based Inference.*

The scripts inside the `code` and `scripts` directories
require R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) and MATLAB version 9.4.0.813654 (R2018a) to run.

The behavioral data of eight public datasets and one republicated dataset can be found in the `code`
directory.
